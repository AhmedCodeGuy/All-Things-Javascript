/**
 * Abstraction:
 * 	- hide details and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or more abstract) level
 *
 * Abstracting array traversal:
 * 	- The word "traverse" means "to go or travel across or over"
 * 	- It just means you need to iterate (go through each element (an element being a portion of data the
 * 		size of whatever data type the array holds))
 *
 * Higher-order functions:
 * 	- Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them
 * 	- If you have already accepted the fact that functions are regular values, there is nothing
 * 		particularly remarkable about the fact that such functions exist. The term comes from mathematics,
 * 		where the distinction between functions and other values is taken more seriously.
 *  - Higher-order functions allow us to abstract over actions, not just values. They come in several forms
 *  - ex:
 *  	- you can have functions that change other functions
 *  	- You can even write functions that provide new types of control flow
 *  	- Passing along arguments, which wraps its argument in another function
 *
 * JSON:
 *  - JSON (pronounced “Jason”), which stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is widely used as a data
 * 		storage and communication format on the Web
 *  - All property names have to be surrounded by double quotes, and only simple data expressions are
 *  	allowed—no function calls, variables, or anything that involves actual computation. Comments are
 *  	not allowed in JSON
 * - JavaScript gives us functions, JSON.stringify and JSON.parse, that convert data from and to this format.
 * 	 The first takes a JavaScript value and returns a JSON-encoded string. The second takes such a string and
 * 	 converts it to the value it encodes.
 * 	 - JSON.stringify converts from JavaScript to JSON
 * 	 - JSON.parse converts from JSON to JavaScript
 * Filtering an array:
 * 	-
 *
 * Transforming with map:
 * 	-
 *
 * Summarizing with reduce:
 * 	-
 *
 * Composability:

 *
 * The cost:

 * Binding:
