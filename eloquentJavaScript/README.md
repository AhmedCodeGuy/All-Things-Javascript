# [Eloquent JavaScript](https://github.com/marijnh/Eloquent-JavaScript)

Code Sandbox
You can use [this page](http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/) to download source code and solutions to exercises for
the book Eloquent JavaScript, and to directly run code in the context of chapters from that book,
either to solve exercises to simply play around.

These are the sources used to build the second edition of Eloquent
JavaScript (http://eloquentjavascript.net).

Update: June 7, 2016

There are many more chapters in the original text, but I've chosen to stop annotating at chapter 6.

Through the annotations and talking with many of my peers, I've learned a lot about the challenges of learning JavaScript on your own. I have discovered a more modern and practical way to learn JavaScript that replaces chapters 7 Through 22 without having to spend hundreds of hours annotating the rest of the book. If you are like me I highly recommend [practical-javascript](https://github.com/SOSANA/All-Things-Javascript/tree/master/practical-javascript/src) by Gordon Zhu. Hit up this repo for more details
