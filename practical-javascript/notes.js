/**
 * Action Items aka 'Project Requirements':
 *  - a common practice in the real world is to break down tasks into small junks
 *  - it helps with not getting lost and side tracked
 *  - makes it easy to see if our app is working the way we want it to working
 *  - works great when having a team of developers collaborating together
 *  - ex: ./v1Requirements
