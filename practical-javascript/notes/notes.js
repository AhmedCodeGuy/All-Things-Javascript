/**
 * Action Items aka 'Project Requirements':
 *  - a common practice in the real world is to break down tasks into small junks
 *  - it helps with not getting lost and side tracked
 *  - makes it easy to see if our app is working the way we want it to working
 *  - works great when having a team of developers collaborating together
 *  - ex: ./v1Requirements.md, .js/misc/
 *  	- Action Items:
 * 			 [X] it should store the todos array on an object
 * 		 	 [X] it should have a displayTodos method
 * 		   [X] it should have a addTodo method
 * 		   [X] it should have a changeTodo method
 * 		   [X] it should have a deleteTodo method
 *
 * Javascript data types:
 * 	- Objects (can be as complex as you want)
 * 	 	- {} // todoList, arrays, functions
 * 	- Primitives (building blocks)
 * 		- String    // 'look at my srting'
 * 		- Number    // 1, 2, 3
 * 		- Boolean   // true, false
 * 		- Undefined // value that hasn't been set
 * 		- Null      // 'nothing'
 *  - object comparisions completely different than compairing Primitives
 *  	- when compairing objects in js the are referred 'Object references' that hold
 *  		memory address for every object created
 *  	- ex: ./objectComparisons.png
