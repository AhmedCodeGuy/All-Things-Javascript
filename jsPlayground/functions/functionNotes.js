/**
 * .apply():
 *  - similar to the call method, invokes the function and lets you set the 'this' keyword but only difference
 *  	is it wants an array of parameters
 *  - see ex: /call-apply-bind
 *
 * .bind():
 *  - does not invoke the function, it creates a copy of the function and you can tell it what the "this"
 *  	variable is
 *  - see ex: /call-apply-bind
 *
 * .call():
 *  - unlike the bind method , call doesn't make a copy it actually executes or invokes it and decides what
 *  	the "this" variable is
 *  - see ex: /call-apply-bind
