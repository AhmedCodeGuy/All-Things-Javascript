/**
 * Recursion:
 *  - good reference src: http://www.sitepoint.com/recursion-functional-javascript/
 *  - is an important programming technique, in which a function calls itself
 *  - is a technique for iterating over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedly until
 *  	it arrives at a result. Most loops can be rewritten in a recursive style, and in some functional
 *   	languages this approach to looping is the default. However, while JavaScriptâ€™s functional coding
 *   	style does support recursive functions, we need to be aware that most JavaScript compilers are not
 *   	currently optimized to support them safely
 *  - is best applied when you need to call the same function repeatedly with different parameters from
 *    within a loop. While it can be used in many situations, it is most effective for solving problems
 *    involving iterative branching, such as fractal math, sorting, or traversing the nodes of complex
 *    or non-linear data structures
 * Calculation of factorials:
 *  - The factorial of a number n is calculated by multiplying 1 * 2 * 3 *...n
 *  -  you can simply call factorial again, passing in the next lowest value.
 *  - The recursion stops when the value is 1
