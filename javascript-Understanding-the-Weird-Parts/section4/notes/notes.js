/**
 * Objects And Functions
 *  - objects are collections of name value pairs. A set of values that are given names
 *  - an object can have properties and methods. The following could be sitting off or
 *    connected to an object:
 *    - Primitive Property: This is called a property (primitive types) ex: boolean,
 *      number, or string
 *    - Object "property": Can have another object connected to it (as child so to speak)
 *      this is also considered a property. Remember we said the value could be another
 *      name value pair collection or that is another object
 *    - Function "method": objects can contain functions. In these cases the function is
 *      calling a mehthod when its sitting on a object, its connected to a object
 *  - objects sit in memory and the core object will have some sort of address in your
 *    computers memory. It will have references to these different properties and methods
 *    which are also sitting in your computers memory. The object has references address in
 *    space, a spot, where these different methods and properties live
 *  - Think about an object as sitting in memory and than having references to other things
 *    sitting memory that are connected it. It knows where its different properites and
 *    methods are: that is primitives, objects, and functions that make up the object
 *
 * Objects And The Dot:
 *  - the dot is a operator (a function) and it takes two parameters ex: person.firstname
 *  - always use the dot operator over the computed member access operator []. see the
 *    d1-objects-and-the-dot folder for more info
 *
 * Namespace:
 *  - a container (just a holder) for variables and functions.
 *  - Typically to keep variables and functions with same name separate
