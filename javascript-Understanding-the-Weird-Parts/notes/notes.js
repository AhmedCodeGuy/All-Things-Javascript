/**
 *  
 * Syntax parser:
 *  - a program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammer is valid
 *  - someone else wrote a program to translate it for the computer, ex: a compiler
 * 
 * Lexical Environment:
 *  - where something sits physically in the code your write
 *  - 'lexical' means 'having to do with words or grammar'. A lexical environment exists in 
 *    programming languages in which where you write something is important
 *  
 *  Execution Context:
 *  - a wrapper to help manage the code that is running.
 *  - there are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currently running is managed via 
 *    execution contexts. It can contain things beyond what you've written in your code
