# [Eloquent JavaScript](https://github.com/marijnh/Eloquent-JavaScript)

Code Sandbox
You can use [this page](http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/) to download source code and solutions to exercises for 
the book Eloquent JavaScript, and to directly run code in the context of chapters from that book, 
either to solve exercises to simply play around.

These are the sources used to build the second edition of Eloquent
JavaScript (http://eloquentjavascript.net).
